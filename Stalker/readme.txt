note about the discord module ###########

when you want to mine the information, you will need your discord token or authorization key, along with the channel, or user ID you want to scrape you can find this easily just look it up on google, this will mine any and all live sessions and messages going through the server, note i did not make it apperent for it to repeat and keep it 100% live to do this 

go into modules, main, then enter the discord module

when you enter the script remove both string and inputs 

then in the headers remove the f and {} brackets and place your  authen key inside the headers then at the very bottom where it has the ID inputed in the brackets of the channel, remove that and place it in the server you want to scrape, then boom save it and your done! 

YOU MUST BE 100% ACCESSED TO THIS SERVER OR IT WILL NOT WORK
