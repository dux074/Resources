# BRUTEY
automation script for Hydra


this is a simple and plain brute forxing script written in python3, if you have hydra installed this will all work, make sure you know the service, email, or smtp, or https you want to brute force and check if it works, if your using large wordlists its suggested to use crunch or rockyou.txt2021 for the latest passwords, brute forcing is a very common but slow process this is why sql injection or xss injection is more commonly used, however brute forcing can come in handy 

i hope everyone finds a good use for it and is able to use it properly 

#############PROCESS OF USE 


step 1 install or git clone the file, cd into the dir, then do python3 Brutey.py 



have fun XD
