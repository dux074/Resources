password generating framework 

# GEN INFO

general information about the PG-GEN2....
alot of people never understood the concepts of hacking accounts, you usually dont target just one accoutn you crack hashes, but a common theroy is if you have a long character and special character password then it will practically be "impossible" to crack or break into, ofc with hashes that doesnt matter but in this case with SSH, Router speedy, FNTP, MTP, FTP, telnet, and more it does, so i decided to make a password generator using python3 to generate special character password lists let this baby run for 30 minutes of whatever option you choose and youll be set for a year just make sure you have a fast brute frocing program
