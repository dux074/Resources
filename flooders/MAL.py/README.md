# MAL.py
MALFORMED PACKET DoS slow HTTP and down websites 

this is a very werid form of a DoS script, since i was editing 
the packet flow of my other UDP-flood ive been experimenting with diferent 
types of packets and accidentally made this, i named it MAL because that stood for
MALFORMED PACKET or an incompkete packet, i tried following the streams and doing a little
investigation and could not find a direct source leaving this packet untraceable without a stream

enjoy :D
