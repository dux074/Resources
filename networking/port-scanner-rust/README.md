simple scanner in rust, i dont know rust really well but holy mother of jesus himself did this take me so lonmg to create from the sys it took me 9 hours without any form of tutorial on how to do it XD

enjoy 

git clone the repo 

cd into the main folder 

then cd into src 

then from then on do the following 

$ this is a threaded scanner so make sure you know how much threads you want $

cargo run -- -j 1000 (suggested) {then you're ip target}

and yes yes i know "flag is unused " it was my first time enjoy it and give me a break XDD


NOTE WHEN SCANNING IF YOU ARE ON BROWSERS OR DOING ANY ONLINE ACTIVITIES THEY WILL LAG AND STOP AS THIS SCANNER IS MAIN
