what is this? 

well its a tool i dveeloped over the course of a few hours in python3 to spy on discord servers without others knowing, or even discord knowing, 

in discord you have the option for dev tools, and if we all know or should know everything is logged, saved, sent, recorded, kept, and held onto 

this tool using reqeusts and json can outp[ut live conversations from a server 


what you need |||||

pip 
json
requests
a OS OFC 
python3 

what does it do 

this tool is nice and just like any other osint tool it gathers information so 

this one does and grabbs the following 

ID
SERVER ID 
USER ID 
USERNAME 
about the chat 
the content 
if mention was true or false 
timestamp
and other info you could well use

this isnt even for servers this can legit be just for one person 
BUT NOTE: IT CATCHES EVERYTHING SENT YOU WILL GET YOUR OWN MESSAGES
