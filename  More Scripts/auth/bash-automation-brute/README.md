# bash-automation-brute
this is a simple script written in the latest version of bash, it is a 15 line automation script for hydra SMPT email brute forcing, 

git clone the repository 

then chmod +x hydra.sh

after that simply just type sudo ./hydra.sh


it really is this simple and the good thing about it is it shows the progress and the bas reads the wordlist as it keeps going on that way you know this progress and how fast it goes, i tried this to penetration test on my email and it does but doesnt work, gmail and SMTP services can sometimes send false posotives which can give you the wrong password, i hope you guys enjoy 

HAVE FUNNN :D
