# H.I.N.T.S
Human Intelligence Narrowing Tool Set - An OSINT questionnaire and research structure meant to assist in organizing findings on high-level targets (Whales) scoped by clients.

# Example Usage
This is a tool to narrow down information after it has been gathered. 

Make sure notes are detailed before proceeding, otherwise it will likely end up getting re-created. 

Create a folder in the program directory named "Images"

Store the cover image intended for the report in the ./Images folder.

`python3 -n <Target_Name> -i <Cover_image.png>`

Just follow along and answer as best you can. Blanks are fine. Just an HTML wrap that can/should be easily modified.
